# Momentum_unfolding_in_miniICAL

Code to unfold the momentum spectra in mini-ICAL.
We have total 8 combinations of low energy and high energy hadron models from corsika. They are unfolded parallely using HTCondor cluster. The jobscript.jdl file will submit jobs to the computing cluster and the output files will be generated in the fileOut folder
